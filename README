SegmentSplitView is an Eclipse plugin that splits an X12 segment into its elements.

To install, add an Eclipse update site that points to http://grailbox.com/eclipse and
walk through a normal installation.

After you add the view (called X12 Segment Split View), copy any X12 segment to
the clipboard. The segment you copy will appear in the view, both in its original
form and as a parsed string in a table, with indices.
